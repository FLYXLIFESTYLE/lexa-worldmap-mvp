## 🎁 BONUS: WHAT TO SAY TO INVESTORS

### "What have you built so far?"
**Answer:**
"We have a working MVP with a complete backend - Neo4j graph database with 200,000 POIs, emotional intelligence AI that calculates personality across 6 dimensions, and a recommendation engine. The frontend conversation flow is live and generating personalized experience scripts. We're ready for user testing."

### "What's unique about LEXA?"
**Answer:**
"Three things: First, our emotional intelligence - we don't just match destinations, we match feelings. Second, our archetype system - we calculate personality profiles that get more accurate with every interaction. Third, our data depth - 200k real POIs with activity types, emotional tags, and luxury scoring. No one else combines all three."

### "How do you make money?"
**Answer:**
"Three revenue streams: One, subscription for charter brokers and luxury salespeople - they create experiences for clients and earn lifetime commissions. Two, booking fees from experiences and cruises. Three, premium features like branded PDFs and white-label versions for luxury brands."

### "What's your biggest challenge?"
**Answer:**
"Getting initial user feedback to refine the conversation flow. That's why we built this MVP - to test with real clients and iterate fast. We're attending pitch contests to get exposure and early adopters."

### "What's next?"
**Answer:**
"Three priorities: One, user testing with 20-30 clients to refine AIlessia's personality. Two, onboarding 5-10 charter brokers to validate the affiliate model. Three, enriching our POI database with more destinations. We can do all three in the next 4 weeks."
