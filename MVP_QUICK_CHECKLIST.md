**Impact**: Can't monetize or demonstrate business model

---

### 5. Emotional Profile Display ⚠️ **50% → 100%**
**Status**: Profile exists in database but not displayed

**Missing:**
- [ ] Emotional profile display in account dashboard
- [ ] Profile visualization component
- [ ] Learning signals display
- [ ] Profile evolution tracking

**Impact**: Users can't see what LEXA knows about them

---

### 6. Landing Page Enhancements ⚠️ **60% → 100%**

**Missing:**
- [ ] Popular scripts section (most popular scripts)
