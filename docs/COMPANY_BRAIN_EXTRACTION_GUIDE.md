## 📝 WHAT TO EXTRACT (Priority Order)

### 1. ⭐ EXPERIENCE SCRIPT EXAMPLES (CRITICAL for AIlessia Training)

**Why This Matters Most:**
- These are GOLD for training AIlessia's Script Composer
- Shows how YOU think about emotional arc design
- Captures your narrative style and vocabulary
- Provides templates for different themes/archetypes

**What to Extract:**
- **Script Titles**: How you name experiences (emotional + destination)
- **Narrative Structures**: Your arc patterns (celebration, renewal, transformation, discovery)
- **Emotional Vocabulary**: Specific words you use to evoke each emotion
- **Signature Moments**: How you craft peak experiences
- **Sensory Anchoring**: How you use smell/taste/sound/sight/touch
- **Upsell Framing**: How you make premium feel inevitable

**Example Extraction:**
```json
{
  "script_title": "Mediterranean Alchemy: Where Discovery Meets Timeless Prestige",
  "theme": "Cultural Immersion + Prestige",
  "destination": "French Riviera",
  "emotional_arc": "Arrival (decompression) → Immersion (discovery) → Peak (exclusive access) → Integration (reflection)",
  "narrative_style": "Evocative, sensory-rich, transformation-focused",
  "signature_moments": [
    "Private after-hours access to villa gardens",
    "Artisan workshop where only locals go",
    "Sunset champagne on hidden terrace"
  ],
  "upsell_psychology": "Frames Blueprint as 'moving from inspiration to reservation' (removes friction)",
  "training_value": "Shows how to blend discovery (artisan workshop) with prestige (private access) naturally"
}
```

**Application:**
- Feed these into AIlessia's Script Composer as training examples
- Build template library organized by: theme, archetype, emotional arc, duration
- Create "Script DNA" patterns AIlessia can remix for new clients
