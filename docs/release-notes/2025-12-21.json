    "description": "LEXA's conversation quality dramatically improved with empathetic responses that build on context",
    "details": "Completely rewrote the conversation engine for natural, empathetic interactions. Key improvements: (1) Context-aware progression through stages: opening → deepening → discovery → recommendation, (2) Extracts and remembers locations, emotions from full conversation history, (3) No more repetitive questions - each response builds on previous answers, (4) Gentle, warm tone with examples in every response, (5) Helper functions track main emotions and desires across turns, (6) Detects user confirmations ('same feeling', 'similar') and adapts accordingly. This transforms LEXA from transactional Q&A into luxury concierge-quality conversation.",
