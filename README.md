## Quick Start (For Beginners)

### Prerequisites

You need these installed on your computer:
1. **Node.js** (version 18 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **Git** - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)

### Step 1: Installation

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
cd lexa-worldmap-mvp
npm install
```

**What this does:** Installs all the code libraries LEXA needs to run.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Accounts

You need accounts with two services (both have free tiers):

#### A. Supabase (Database & Authentication)
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign up
2. Create a new project
3. Go to Settings → API
4. Copy your:
   - **Project URL**
   - **Anon/Public Key**
   - **Service Role Key**

#### B. Anthropic (AI)
1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) and sign up
2. Go to API Keys
3. Create a new key and copy it

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env.local` in the `lexa-worldmap-mvp` folder and add your keys:

```env
# Supabase (Database & Authentication)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Anthropic Claude API
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

**What this does:** Connects LEXA to your accounts securely.

### Step 4: Set Up Database

Run this command to create the database tables:

```bash
# If you have Supabase CLI installed:
supabase db push

# If not, copy the SQL from supabase/migrations/001_lexa_schema.sql
# and run it in your Supabase SQL Editor
```

**What this does:** Creates 4 tables (sessions, messages, preferences, experience_briefs) with proper security.

### Step 5: Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

**What this does:** Starts LEXA on your computer.

Open your browser to: **http://localhost:3000**

## How LEXA Works

### Conversation Flow

LEXA guides users through 10 stages:

1. **WELCOME** - Permission & positioning
2. **DISARM** - Surface hidden dissatisfaction
3. **MIRROR** - Reflect hypothesis & get score
4. **MICRO_WOW** - Prove value with one recommendation
5. **COMMIT** - Choose Fast or Deep path
6. **BRIEFING_COLLECT** - Gather 10 required fields
7. **SCRIPT_DRAFT** - Deliver experience script
8. **REFINE** - Up to 3 adjustments
9. **HANDOFF** - Create experience brief for Operations Agent
10. **FOLLOWUP** - 24-48h relationship loop

### Required Data Fields

LEXA collects these 10 fields for the Operations Agent:

**Core Trio** (at least one required):
- When (timeframe/dates) - stored as `when_at`
- Where (destination) - stored as `where_at`
- Theme (experience type)

**Additional Fields**:
- Budget
- Duration
- Emotional goals
- Must-haves
- Best experiences (and why)
- Worst experiences (and why)
- Bucket list items

### Operations Agent Handoff

When a conversation reaches the HANDOFF stage, LEXA automatically:
1. Extracts all collected data from the session
2. Creates a record in the `experience_briefs` table
3. Sets status to `'complete'`
4. Includes conversation signals (trust score, skepticism, tone)

The Operations Agent can then query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM experience_briefs WHERE status = 'complete';

-- Note: Column names use when_at and where_at (not reserved keywords)
```
